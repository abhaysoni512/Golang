Implement Stack DS using Generics / Interface	Freq asked	https://go.dev/play/p/Lba4B5WTFQS
How to mock the above Push(), Pop(), isEmpty() for testing		
Can you use interfaces to change the above stack implementation		
Using the above implementation as base, use goroutine to do the push operation		
Since the stack is being printed in sequence, do you think this classifies as a real concurrent operation

"Write a Go program that spawns two goroutines. Each goroutine should increment a shared counter variable,
but only one goroutine should increment it by 1, and the other should increment it by 2.
The two goroutines should alternate in their operations, ensuring the increments are performed in a synchronized manner,
and the final value of the counter should be consistent.

Ex:
1  (increment by 1)
3  (increment by 2)
4  (increment by 1)
6  (increment by 2)
7  (increment by 1)
Final counter value: 7"		
"Write an go routine that will increase an counter after every 1 second and exits 
the go routne lets say after 10 seconds"		
"Write 2 goroutines that prints ping pong alterntively and exit both the goroutines
 after 10 seconds (show both buffered and unbuffered approaches)"		
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water. Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.		"Two pointer question
