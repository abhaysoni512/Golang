"Implement the following Data structures using Generics as well as Interfaces:-
 - Stack
 - Queue
 - Linked List"
string to byte conversion
"In a slice of int(s), 
 - Check for duplicate values
 - Find duplicate int count
 - For a given value 'k' (less than slice length), return top 'k' duplicate int(s) 
[Note: Aim for a complexity of O(n) or O(log n)]"
In a slice of int(s), find the largest and second largest number
"In a slice of int(s), find the last occurance of an element
[Note: Aim for a complexity of O(log n)]"
"Write a program to reverse strings.
[Note: It should also take care to correctly reverse characters from languages other than English like Chinese/Japanese/Spanish/etc.
Ex: 日本語                語本日                álphãbét]"
"Write a program to reverse integers
[Note: It should also take into account, if it is a negative integer]
Examples
 Input : 12345        Output : 54321
 Input : -12345        Output : -54321"
"Given a slice of type ""User"" with fields ""firstName"", ""lastName"" and ""age"", implement a custom sorting logic to
 - Sort the data by age
 - Sort the data by firstName"
"Given a paragraph, count the occurance of each word in the paragraph and print them.
[Note: Consider only characters and ignore all other punctuations - space, comma, full stop, single quotes, double quotes, etc]"
"Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice."
"Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.
        Input: ""babad""
        Output: ""bab""
        Note: ""aba"" is also a valid answer.

        Input: ""cbbd""
        Output: ""bb"""
"Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Examples:

Given ""abcabcbb"", the answer is ""abc"", which the length is 3.

Given ""bbbbb"", the answer is ""b"", with the length of 1.

Given ""pwwkew"", the answer is ""wke"", with the length of 3.
Note that the answer must be a substring, ""pwke"" is a subsequence and not a substring."
